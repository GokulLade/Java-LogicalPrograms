/*	Q1. How can we find the length of the array in java?

   Solution:- By using length variable as method support is not there through array object 
              creation but few pre define methods present in ARRAYS class 
           
	> Length variable 
*/

// Sample code for length variable
public class FindingLengthOfArrayProgram03 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int arr[] = new int[5];

		System.out.println(arr.length);

	}
}
